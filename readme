This study presents a real-time surface electromyography (sEMG) hand gesture recognition system for neural prosthesis applications, leveraging the Ninapro DB1 dataset. We implemented a sliding window framework with balanced sampling and PCA-based dimensionality reduction to enhance computational efficiency and stability. Three traditional machine learning classifiers (KNN, SVM, and Random Forest) were optimized and evaluated in intra-subject settings. To address the challenge of prediction jitter in real-time scenarios, we proposed a trigger-n decision mechanism, which significantly improved the reliability of the control signals. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline achieves high classification accuracy (above 0.7 for all models) in a 13-class task, with PCA reducing the feature dimension by over 98% while maintaining or even improving model performance. The findings establish a robust engineering baseline and provide practical insights for the development of next-generation smart prosthetic hand control systems.
